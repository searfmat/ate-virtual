## *This is a Test Site*
*It was written by a BHLP team to showcase a possible content managment system.
It is one of many options. It is very barebones right now, but I wrote the code for this in just a few hours. More can always be added.*

## Welcome to the Art Therapy Express Virtual Hub!
When everything that is going on right now, it is important to feel connected. Isolation is hard, and we're here to help. Lisa and her team have been incredibly generous in providing all sorts of materials to help you and your child restore a sense of normalcy.

We tried our best to make this layout as simple as possible, because complexity is not something anyone really wants right now.

## How to Use the Virtual Hub
The tabs at the top of the page will help you navigate the site. Each tab contains project instructions in a pdf format.

Just click the link(s) for the project you want and it will open directly in your browser.

 - No fancy tech
 - No slow page loading
 - No bland art
